            Thanks for your contribution! Join our Slack: [https://join.slack.com/t/opsimate/shared_invite/zt-39bq3x6et-NrVCZzH7xuBGIXmOjJM7gA](https://join.slack.com/t/opsimate/shared_invite/zt-39bq3x6et-NrVCZzH7xuBGIXmOjJM7gA)  
            Please make sure to include an image with your PR — it really helps us review and understand the changes better.
            Only in rare cases will we accept a PR without one.
            Also, take a moment to review your code to ensure it’s clear, readable, and easy to follow.
            PRs from contributors who haven’t joined our Slack community or starred the repository won’t be reviewed — we’d love to see you join and be part of the project!
