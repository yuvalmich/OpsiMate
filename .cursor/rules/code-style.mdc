# Cursor Code Style Rule

Always design for split subcomponents and strong separation of concerns.

1. Component Structure:
   - Each component must have its own subdirectory with the same name as the component.
   - The main component file is `${componentName}.tsx` inside the subdirectory.
   - Include an `index.ts` file that exports the component for clean imports.
   - Example: `AlertsHeatmap/AlertsHeatmap.tsx` and `AlertsHeatmap/index.ts`.

2. Subcomponents & Hooks:
   - If logic/UI grows, split into subcomponents or hooks.
   - Each subcomponent/hook lives in its own file within the component directory.
   - File name matches export name exactly.
   - Props interface stays in the same file above the definition.

3. Utils:
   - Stateless pure helper functions go to `${componentName}.utils.ts` in the component directory.

4. Constants:
   - No hardcoded strings or magic numbers.
   - Put them in `${componentName}.constants.ts` in the component directory and export/import.

5. Types:
   - No anonymous inline object types.
   - Use interfaces only.
   - Extract shared/non-props interfaces to `${componentName}.types.ts` in the component directory.
   - Props interfaces remain in the component/hook file.
